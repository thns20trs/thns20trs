üéØ **Lead Security Engineer | Fractional CISO | Cloud & GRC Expert**

I'm a security engineer with 10+ years of experience securing cloud-native infrastructure, designing secure-by-default architectures, and building scalable AppSec and GRC programs. I‚Äôve led security strategy and compliance readiness for SaaS, fintech, and healthcare clients‚Äîachieving 100% clean audit outcomes across SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

I love translating complex security risks into actionable solutions that empower developers, satisfy auditors, and reduce real-world threats.

Currently open to impactful roles where I can own and scale security programs in high-growth environments.

I'm teaching myself/currently learning Python and how I can apply it to the security space for automation and with tools like Tenable, Splunk, and AWS services. I'm making my way through self directed curicculum I had help crafting from ChatGPT.
