# Hi, I'm Tom

**Lead Security Engineer | Fractional CISO | Cloud & GRC Expert**

I'm a security engineer with 10+ years of experience securing cloud-native infrastructure, designing secure-by-default architectures, and building scalable AppSec and GRC programs. I’ve led security strategy and compliance readiness across multiple industries achieving 100% clean audit outcomes for clients seeking compliance certification and attestation with SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

I love translating complex security risks into actionable solutions that empower developers, satisfy auditors, and reduce real-world threats.

Currently open to impactful roles where I can own and scale security programs in high-growth environments.
